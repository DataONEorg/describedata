	<!--DRAFT: This is a draft Dublin Core profile proposed for DataONE Member Nodes wishing to submit
	    metadata using a Dublin Core profile.  It was initially created by taking the Dryad metadata profile and 
	    removing the things which are Dryad-specific out of it, then addiing in (as optional) terms relevant to 
	    MN's expressing interest in DC.  At present, relatively few terms are mapped to DataONE SearchMetadata
	    fields, but this mapping will be extended based on input from users and DataONE preferences.  

	    If no SearchMetadata field is indicated, this means that the term is not explictly indexed.  In some
	    cases, future mappings are marked as PROPOSED.  Note, that all fields are available in the full-text 
	    index for the metadata, so a full-text search through any of the DataONE search interfaces will match 
	    regardless of the term indexing.  
	    -->
	<!--Issues in progress: 
	    1. How should multiple spatial terms be handled by DataONE? 
	    2. How should multiple temporal terms handled by DataONE? 
	    3. PROPOSED: where indexed terms of type text are repeated, they should always be aggregated into the designated SearchMetadata
	       field.  This allows a supplier, for example, to provide a description in multiple languages and have all of those indexed.
	       This indexing may be imperfect, but it can provide at least some improvement in discovery for non-English users.

	<!--Usage notes:
	    * &&&&& dateSubmitted versus system metadata submission date and usage.
	    * &&&&& hasPart versus overall ORE envelope
	    * dcterms:identifier: The metadata can specify the identifiers for component parts or the dataset itself.  This is included
	      for compatibility with other uses for the metadata.  DataONE uses the identifiers as specified in the ORE map (package file).  
	      Any identifiers listed under this term for the metadata file will be in the full-text index and visible when the metadata is
	      viewed, but otherwise not used by DataONE.  
	    * An organization may provide a description and/or an abstract.  A common practice in some communities is for the description 
	      to be short (a sentence) and have a longer abstract.  Currently, DataONE only indexes the description field into 
	      SearchMetadata.abstract, due to how Dryad constructs DC metadata.  
	    * dcterms:hasPart: This term is included for compatibility with other uses of DC metadata, for display to the end user,
	      and for MN internal use.  For DataONE processing, the parts of a dataset need to be specified in the ORE envelope.
